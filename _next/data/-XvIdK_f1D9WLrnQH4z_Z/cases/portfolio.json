After trying out\ndifferent looks and styles, it all came together in August 2023. My main goal\nwas to have a unique but not overly complex portfolio. One cool thing? The\nhorizontal scrolling. This setup makes each project stand out more, without\ndistractions on the side. This design choice was a bit of an experiment, but\nI'm happy with how it turned out.</li>\n<li>The site has a dark look with some neon touches, kind of like my CV's is\nstyled. This makes sure the projects are the main attraction, standing out\nagainst the dark backdrop.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>The app is crafted with Next.js combined with SASS, ESlint and some other\nmodern tools, guaranteeing swift responses and fluid interactions. Using the\nbenefits of module-based styling, each part keeps its own style. There are\nmoving animations made with tools like Stylefire and Popmotion. The app uses\nstatic pre-rendering for faster page loads, and a seamless user experience.</li>\n<li>The app boasts some neat animations. Things show up, fade, and move in a\nspecific style, elevating the overall atmosphere. A small tool has been\nintroduced that brings text to life. It can make text appear as if it's being\ntyped, swap words, and even transition languages letter by letter, inspired by\nthe Cyberpunk game. For those interested, the tool can be found in the\ncomponents/Effects folder.</li>\n<li>Although I thought about having the site in different languages, I kept it to\none for now. It's just simpler that way.</li>\n<li>And while the site adjusts to different screen sizes, it looks best on bigger\nscreens like desktops and tablets.</li>\n<li>The site has been exported to a static format, allowing it to benefit from\nfree hosting.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"One of the design versions is immortalized in a mockup\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/portfolio/index.jpg\">\n</figure>","currentNum":3,"totalCases":13,"prevCase":{"id":"thetourfolks","title":"The Tour Folks","date":"2023-07-30","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["Full-Cycle Development","UX/UI Design"],"country":"Italy","cover":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dlwvibxw6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1693401905/cover_nczgbg","description":"Milan Tours Booking System","stack":["TypeScript","TRPC","Yarn","Zod","React.js","React Query","Next.js","Tailwind","Ant Design","PostCSS","PrismaORM","PostgreSQL","ESlint","Prettier","Figma","Photoshop"]},"nextCase":{"id":"cv-2.0v","title":"CV Design 2.0v","date":"2023-03-01","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["Design","Personal Branding"],"country":"","cover":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/cv-2.0v/shot.png","description":"A fresh, dark-themed twist on my CV ðŸ‘»"},"title":"Web Portfolio","team":"my cat Qwerty's paws","date":"2023-07-11","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["Personal Branding","UX/UI","Full-Cycle Development"],"country":"Paws","cover":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/portfolio/index.jpg","description":"","stack":["JavaScript","React.js","Next.js","Sass","ESlint","Github Actions"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
