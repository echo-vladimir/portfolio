- This portfolio site showcases projects I've worked on. After trying out
  different looks and styles, it all came together in August 2023. My main goal
  was to have a unique but not overly complex portfolio. One cool thing? The
  horizontal scrolling. This setup makes each project stand out more, without
  distractions on the side. This design choice was a bit of an experiment, but
  I'm happy with how it turned out.
- The site has a dark look with some neon touches, kind of like my CV's is
  styled. This makes sure the projects are the main attraction, standing out
  against the dark backdrop.

- The app is crafted with Next.js combined with SASS, ESlint and some other
  modern tools, guaranteeing swift responses and fluid interactions. Using the
  benefits of module-based styling, each part keeps its own style. There are
  moving animations made with tools like Stylefire and Popmotion. The app uses
  static pre-rendering for faster page loads, and a seamless user experience.
- The app boasts some neat animations. Things show up, fade, and move in a
  specific style, elevating the overall atmosphere. A small tool has been
  introduced that brings text to life. It can make text appear as if it's being
  typed, swap words, and even transition languages letter by letter, inspired by
  the Cyberpunk game. For those interested, the tool can be found in the
  components/Effects folder.
- Although I thought about having the site in different languages, I kept it to
  one for now. It's just simpler that way.
- And while the site adjusts to different screen sizes, it looks best on bigger
  screens like desktops and tablets.
- The site has been exported to a static format, allowing it to benefit from
  free hosting.
