description: "UI/UX Design for an Ukrainian online e-bike store"
---

This e-bike online store from Ukraine aimed to offer a variety of e-bikes and
bicycle parts. It was designed for easy shopping and featured a fun tool for
customers to design their own custom e-bikes.

- Joining this project was exciting! I focused on the UI/UX design, ensuring
  that the website was both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. The
  centerpiece of my involvement was designing the interactive bike builder,
  which allowed users to mix and match from a range of e-bike parts to visualize
  their custom build.
- Working hand-in-hand with a team of developers, we ensured seamless
  integration of my designs into the platform. This synergy made it possible for
  us to roll out the builder efficiently, giving users an engaging and intuitive
  tool that revolutionized their shopping experience. The feedback was
  overwhelmingly positive, reflecting the dedication and detail we put into
  every facet of this project.
