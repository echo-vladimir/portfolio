- Who said CVs always have to be on a white backdrop? I decided to step away
  from the usual and add a fresh twist.
- For my CV's new look, I chose a stylish dark backdrop, spiced up with bright
  accents that remind of city lights during nighttime. The overall vibe hints at
  a futuristic touch without going too over the top.
- Plus, navigating it is a breeze thanks to the interactive PDF menu â€“ it feels
  like you're exploring an interface, not just a document. Clicking on different
  sections leads you to specific pages, creating a dynamic and immersive
  experience similar to navigating a user interface.
- I managed to reduce the PDF size from 60MB to a friendlier 3-5MB, but,
  unfortunately, some graphic quality was lost along the way.
