Global Traffic Systems was a notable European player in the field of traffic
management. The company specialized in developing practical software and
hardware solutions to enhance road traffic efficiency. Its contributions, such
as tools for traffic light coordination and real-time traffic monitoring
systems, brought tangible improvements to daily commuting.

## Sadly, Global Traffic Systems isn't around anymore, so their website doesn't work now :(

- Website Development: At Global Traffic Systems, one of my pivotal roles was to
  spearhead the design and execution of the company's website. From ideation to
  implementation, I was deeply involved in ensuring a smooth and adaptive user
  experience across multiple devices.
- B2B Interface Design & Development: Beyond working on the main website, my
  role expanded into designing and implementing interfaces for our specialized
  traffic management systems. This role marked the beginning of my journey into
  frontend development, as I began to embed parts of the design myself. My
  contributions prominently featured systems like traffic light control,
  congestion management, and other custom traffic solutions for various
  companies and government initiatives.
- Branding & Promotion: My involvement wasn't restricted to just the digital
  space. I also took part in bolstering the company's offline brand identity by
  crafting impactful promotional materials, from leaflets and brochures to
  presentations, ensuring brand uniformity across all touchpoints. Moreover, the
  creation of the company's distinct logo was a task I took pride in.
