In this project, the roles were dynamic, with collaboration at its core. Over a
3-month period, I was engaged in both UI/UX design and front-end development.
Collaborating closely with a full-stack developer, we jointly addressed various
challenges. This approach ensured that we covered every aspect of the design and
development process. However, due to certain circumstances, the project remained
as a demo version.
