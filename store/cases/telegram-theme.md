  "A dark theme with a touch of purple designed for an official Telegram contest"
---

For the official Telegram contest, a comfortable dark theme was designed. The
standout feature was the touch of purple, which added some style without being
too bright. Great care was taken with the color choices, ensuring everything
felt cohesive and user-friendly.
