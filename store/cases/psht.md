- On a freelance basis, I took on a full-cycle development project for the
  Polish Tinker Breeders Association. This covered everything, from the first
  idea and design to the final coding touches. This system became a key tool for
  tracking Tinker horses in Poland. It stored crucial details about each horse,
  like their medical records, awards, and ancestry. Starting with a basic
  version, I then built it out into a more detailed system, which became super
  helpful for the breeders association.
- For the tech side, I used tools like JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, and Sass to
  create it. I designed its look with Figma. I also set up a database with
  MongoDB to store all the data. For safety, I used tools like Passport to make
  sure only allowed people could access the system.
