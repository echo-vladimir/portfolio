{"pageProps":{"caseData":{"id":"thetourfolks","contentHtml":"<ul>\n<li>This app is the result of intensive work over the course of four to five\r\nmonths, with a focal point on creating an efficient booking system for tours\r\nin and around Milan. The main objective was to craft a bespoke booking system\r\nfrom scratch, addressing the client's distinct requirements. Initially, an\r\noptimized static RWD site for bookings was established. To enhance\r\nfunctionality, various payment methods were integrated using the Stripe\r\nadapter, and a specialized CRM system was set up, designed for roles such as\r\neditor, promoter, manager, and others. This system not only simplifies order\r\nhandling but also enables the team to promptly cater to client needs.\r\nPromoters have the convenience to add tourists to groups right from the\r\nstreets, ensuring that both street sign-ups and online reservations merge\r\nseamlessly into the same tour groups. On top of these features, an advanced\r\nWYSIWYG tool was introduced for effortless content management.</li>\n<li>Another distinctive feature of the platform is the ability for clients, after\r\nchoosing a specific tour, to decide on the time group of the tour. This\r\nallows, for example, families or friends to choose times when there are fewer\r\npeople, ensuring a more individual and comfortable travel experience. Why was\r\nthis mechanism included? It adds flexibility to the booking process, allowing\r\ncustomers to maximize their experience according to their preferences.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Planning</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>After thorough discussions and understanding the client's requirements for\r\nthe Milan tour booking app, a specific strategy was laid out to provide an\r\nintuitive and efficient service. A technology stack was chosen that best\r\nsuited the project's goals, the timeframe, and the fact that I was the sole\r\ndeveloper. Additionally, a brief competitive analysis was undertaken to\r\ngauge the market landscape and key competitors. Based on this, a clear\r\ndevelopment roadmap was drafted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Design</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In many sites catering to small and medium businesses, there's often an\r\nunnecessary plethora of features. Instead, we championed minimalism, with\r\ndesign cues like the unique marble fractures. We started with paper sketches\r\nbut quickly transitioned to a low-fidelity prototype due to time\r\nconstraints, which allowed the client to grasp the information structure.\r\nFrom there, we transitioned directly to coding, making design adjustments\r\nduring the development phase. While we had numerous innovative ideas,\r\nprioritizing a swift launch meant deferring some to future updates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frontend</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid Evolution: Given the time constraints, the design process was agile.\r\nTransitioning swiftly from initial paper sketches to low-fidelity prototypes\r\nensured the client's early engagement. Subsequent stages focused on direct\r\nweb design, accommodating iterative feedback and immediate adjustments.</li>\n<li>To maintain consistency and ensure a seamless user interface, the CRM\r\nbenefited from the structured Ant Design system. The main website,\r\nmeanwhile, was crafted using TailwindCSS, ensuring a fluid and modern\r\naesthetic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Development</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>TypeScript: Chosen for its robust type-checking capabilities and a\r\npreference for solo development. TypeScript minimizes runtime errors, making\r\nit easier to debug and maintain as a solo developer.</li>\n<li>tRPC: Valued for its dual-sided type usage, enhancing efficiency in solo\r\ndevelopment environments. Its integration with React Query optimizes remote\r\nprocedure calls, streamlining the development process.</li>\n<li>Next.js: Recognized for SEO pre-rendering, this framework offers a\r\nharmonious blend of SSR and SPA, ideal for the CRM's admin panel where\r\nperformance takes precedence over SEO.</li>\n<li>Prisma &#x26; PostgreSQL: Opting for Prisma ORM ensured seamless interaction with\r\nPostgreSQL. This selection was also influenced by Prisma's convenient\r\nmodel-to-type import system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Quality</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In the project, I used tools like ESLint and Prettier, combined with\r\nTypeScript helped to make the code safer by catching errors early. With\r\nthese tools, the code quality improved, making it more reliable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deployment</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up the application on a Linux-based environment.</li>\n<li>Employed Nginx as a reverse proxy to facilitate faster response times and\r\naccommodate larger traffic influx.</li>\n<li>Configured DNS settings for streamlined domain-to-IP mapping and enhanced\r\naccess speed.</li>\n<li>Prioritized server security with robust configurations to ward off potential\r\nthreats.</li>\n<li>Established a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub, allowing for continuous and\r\nseamless updates in line with the evolving codebase.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><a href=\"https://thetourfolks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Release</a></p>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Landing page with layered video elements creating a dynamic visual experience.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks1.png\">\n    <figcaption>Dynamic Landing Page</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Design sample with marble fractures intertwined with minimalist accents.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks2.png\">\n    <figcaption>Marble &#x26; Minimalism RWD Design Showcase</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Blog posts with clean formatting and visual emphasis.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks3.png\">\n    <figcaption>Blog Posts</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"In-depth view of a single blog post showcasing its layout and content.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks4.png\">\n    <figcaption>Hover Blog Post View</figcaption> \n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Interactive WYSIWYG editor for crafting content.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks5.png\">\n    <figcaption>WYSIWYG Post Editor</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Interface samples for ticket purchasing experience.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks6.png\">\n    <figcaption>Ticket Purchase Interface</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"CRM screens tailored for a specific user role.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks7.png\">\n    <figcaption> Role-Specific CRM Screens</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Tour group status tracking interface for a particular role.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks8.png\">\n    <figcaption> Tour Group Tracking</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Tabular representation for order management.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks9.png\">\n    <figcaption>Order Control Table</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Interface for creating tours with user role settings in RBAC.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks10.png\">\n    <figcaption>Tour Creation &#x26; RBAC Options</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Distinctive UI elements and widgets.\" src=\"/media/thetourfolks/TheTourFolks12.png\">\n    <figcaption>Some Interface Components</figcaption>\n</figure>","currentNum":1,"totalCases":13,"prevCase":{"id":"telegram-theme","title":"Telegram Theme","date":"2019-03-04","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["UX/UI","Design"],"country":"","cover":"/media/telegram-theme/shot.jpg","description":"A dark theme with a touch of purple designed for an official Telegram contest"},"nextCase":{"id":"portfolio","title":"Web Portfolio","team":"my cat Qwerty's paws","date":"2023-07-11","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["Personal Branding","UX/UI","Full-Cycle Development"],"country":"Paws","cover":"/media/portfolio/index.jpg","description":"","stack":["JavaScript","React.js","Next.js","Sass","ESlint"]},"title":"The Tour Folks","date":"2023-07-30","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["Full-Cycle Development","UX/UI Design"],"country":"Italy","cover":"/media/thetourfolks/cover.jpg","description":"Milan Tours Booking System","stack":["TypeScript","TRPC","Yarn","Zod","React.js","React Query","Next.js","Tailwind","Ant Design","PostCSS","PrismaORM","PostgreSQL","ESlint","Prettier","Figma","Photoshop"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
