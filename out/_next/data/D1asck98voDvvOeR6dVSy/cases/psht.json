This covered everything, from the first\r\nidea and design to the final coding touches. This system became a key tool for\r\ntracking Tinker horses in Poland. It stored crucial details about each horse,\r\nlike their medical records, awards, and ancestry. Starting with a basic\r\nversion, I then built it out into a more detailed system, which became super\r\nhelpful for the breeders association.</li>\n<li>For the tech side, I used tools like JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, and Sass to\r\ncreate it. I designed its look with Figma. I also set up a database with\r\nMongoDB to store all the data. For safety, I used tools like Passport to make\r\nsure only allowed people could access the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Final Design Release\" src=\"/media/psht/psht-members.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>Final UI(with Mock Data)</figcaption>\n</figure>","currentNum":4,"totalCases":13,"prevCase":{"id":"cv-2.0v","title":"CV Design 2.0v","date":"2023-03-01","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["Design","Personal Branding"],"country":"","cover":"/media/cv-2.0v/shot.png","description":"A fresh, dark-themed twist on my CV ðŸ‘»"},"nextCase":{"id":"nrg","title":"NRG","team":"Star Way Â· Web Agency","date":"2022-03-15","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["UX/UI","Design","Development","Front-end"],"country":"Ukraine","cover":"/media/nrg/shot2.png","description":"Eco-energy & Building Systems"},"title":"PSHT","date":"2022-07-13","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["Full-Cycle Development","UX/UI","Front-end","Back-end"],"country":"Poland","cover":"/media/psht/psht-members.jpg","description":"Polish Tinker Breeders Association CRM System","stack":["JavaScript","NodeJS","Express","MongoDB","EJS","Sass","ESlint","Figma"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
