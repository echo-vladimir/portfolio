From ideation to\r\nimplementation, I was deeply involved in ensuring a smooth and adaptive user\r\nexperience across multiple devices.</li>\n<li>B2B Interface Design &#x26; Development: Beyond working on the main website, my\r\nrole expanded into designing and implementing interfaces for our specialized\r\ntraffic management systems. This role marked the beginning of my journey into\r\nfrontend development, as I began to embed parts of the design myself. My\r\ncontributions prominently featured systems like traffic light control,\r\ncongestion management, and other custom traffic solutions for various\r\ncompanies and government initiatives.</li>\n<li>Branding &#x26; Promotion: My involvement wasn't restricted to just the digital\r\nspace. I also took part in bolstering the company's offline brand identity by\r\ncrafting impactful promotional materials, from leaflets and brochures to\r\npresentations, ensuring brand uniformity across all touchpoints. Moreover, the\r\ncreation of the company's distinct logo was a task I took pride in.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Emblem of Global Traffic Systems\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/Logo.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>Corporate Identity: The GTS's Logo</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"GTS Web App Interface\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/shot.png\">\n    <figcaption>Corporate Interface of the GTS Web Platform</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/lubin.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/2.5min.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Overview of Products &#x26; Services\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/GTS-Products.png\">\n    <figcaption>GTS's Comprehensive Catalogue of Products &#x26; Services</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Detailed Product Synopsis\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/GTS-Product-1.png\">\n    <figcaption>Thorough Presentation of a GTS Product Offering</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Functional Blueprint\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/GTS-Product-2.png\">\n    <figcaption>Product Functionality Described with Precision</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Technical Configurations\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/GTS-Product-3.png\">\n    <figcaption>Detail-Oriented Technical Specifications</figcaption>\n</figure>","currentNum":10,"totalCases":14,"prevCase":{"id":"eleek","title":"E-bike Store","team":"Star Way Â· Web Agency","date":"2021-03-21","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["UX/UI","Design"],"country":"Ukraine","cover":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/eleek/shot1.png","description":"UI/UX Design for an Ukrainian online e-bike store"},"nextCase":{"id":"cookbook","title":"CookBook","date":"2020-08-02","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["UX/UI","Design"],"country":"","cover":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/cookbook/cover.jpg","description":"Interactive Food Preparation Assistance"},"title":"Global Traffic Systems","date":"2020-10-21","lang":"en","size":"L","tags":["UX/UI","Design","Development","Front-end"],"country":"Poland","cover":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echo-vladimir/portfolio/main/public/media/gts/Logo.jpg","description":"Pioneering Solutions in Traffic Management"}},"__N_SSG":true}
