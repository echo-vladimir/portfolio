## Overview

This app shows the projects I've done. It's like a gallery of my skills and
work. The design is dark with some bright neon colors. Everything was made by
hand. The animations make the site feel alive. But the best part? It uses
horizontal scrolling. This lets each project get the attention it deserves.
